      "content": "To ensure users can avoid liquidation easily, Compound III market is being deployed on Polygon with USDC as the borrowable asset, and the market is being seeded with 500k USDC. At launch, users can use WETH, WBTC, MATIC, DAI, USDT, and USDC as collateral. Seeding the market with USDC will provide a cushion for users and create a sustainable market. Additionally, the proposal includes setting the pause guardian to a Gnosis multisig, implementing risk parameters based on recommendations from Gauntlet, and modestly reallocating some of the v2 USDT COMP rewards to borrowers in the new market.",
