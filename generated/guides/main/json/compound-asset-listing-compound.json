      "content": "OpenZeppelin, in collaboration with Compound, has developed a structured process to streamline the listing of assets. Aiming to address Compound's security risks, this method is based on a review of past asset listing proposals and community discussions, and is influenced by procedures used by other protocols. The result of this endeavor is a detailed checklist to assess security risks and a step-by-step guide for asset listing proposals.\n\nTo employ this process, users must first familiarize themselves with the process guide, which details how to manage asset listings securely from start to finish. As part of the process, Gauntlet offers a free Market Risk Assessment Framework. The checklist serves as a requisite information sharing tool for the community, marking the first step in the Asset Listing Process. It is also crucial to review the risks to understand the reasoning behind our checklist, process, and potential integration issues.\n\nOur primary objective was to develop an initial process to guide the community in securely listing assets. The community is encouraged to review and suggest improvements to this work. Initially, we aimed to list main exploration results and summarize known risks of the Compound protocol. We produced a Risks document focusing on risks associated with external asset interaction. This document serves as a reminder for anyone evaluating new asset listings, detailing each risk category and how current designs might mitigate them.\n\nFollowing the risk analysis, we recognized the need to consider specific asset risks during listing. Consequently, we created a checklist of queries and information requests for use during the asset listing process. This checklist aims to address concerns specific to each asset and its integration. Prior to proposing an asset listing, the proposer must review this checklist and provide the requested information for a community check on potential integration issues. The final component of our process includes reviewing the risks, completing the checklist, and adhering to other intermediate steps.\n\nThis initiative is aimed at establishing a secure and structured asset listing process, with scope for community feedback and enhancements over time. Future improvement suggestions include automated integrations for mandatory checklist completion, checklist autocompletion to simplify proposal submission, modifications to the checklist based on community requirements, improvements in tooling, formalizing community member roles for checklist verification, and creation of a scoring framework",

      "content": "The Compound Asset Listing Checklist provides a thorough framework for anyone proposing a new asset listing. First, general information about the token asset, including the name, project description, potential benefits to the Compound community, and pertinent resources such as websites and social media links, must be provided. Information about the proposer, their relationship with the token, and any social channel metrics are also required.\n\nNext, a detailed Market Risk Assessment is necessary. This involves submitting the token's market cap, its historical volatility, the largest exchanges where it is listed, and any major smart contract balances. Information about the token's total supply and emission schedule is also needed. It's important to note that Gauntlet, a simulation platform for building financial models of blockchain protocols and applications, will pull live data for their market risk assessment after the checklist is submitted.\n\nThirdly, the decentralization aspect of the asset needs to be considered. Information about the asset's distribution among token holders, privileged roles in the token contract, and whether the asset is pausable or has a blacklist or whitelist should be provided.\n\nThe fourth section delves into smart contract risks, considering the asset's codebase, on-chain activity, and overall security posture. The proposer must provide information about audits, active bug bounty programs, and emergency contacts, as well as any additional security tools used in development.\n\nThe fifth section explores the token's multi-chain strategy and contract behavior. Information about whether the token will include implementations on other networks, how it deviates from a standard ERC20 implementation, and its unique features should be provided.\n\nFinally, the price feed behavior, upgradability, and initial requirements need to be assessed. This includes the frequency of price updates, the entity responsible for these updates, and the threshold for price change that triggers an update. Additionally, information about the token's upgradability, who is authorized to upgrade it, and the upgradeability design should be presented. A few initial requirements include setting the collateral factor to 0 and establishing a supply cap if necessary.\n\nCommunity members should review all the information provided carefully before approving a new asset. Verification of the information, assessment of new contracts, evaluation of documentation quality, and review of the token test suite or integration simulations results are all vital parts of the community check. All proposals must be first posted in the Compound forum New Markets category, and each proposal should relate solely to the listing of one token.",
