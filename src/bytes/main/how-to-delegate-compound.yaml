      To delegate voting rights in Compound Governance, we need a web3 wallet
      and a balance of COMP tokens. It's essential to understand that an
      undelegated wallet cannot vote, even for itself, until manually delegated.

      You need to decide whether to engage in Manual Voting or Delegate Voting.
      Manual Voting allows you to vote on your behalf, while Delegate Voting
      permits someone else to vote on your behalf, such as a trusted entity or
      protocol.

      If opting for Manual Voting, simply click the "Delegate" button on the
      Compound Voting Interface. If you choose the option of Delegate Voting,
      after clicking "Delegate," you are supposed to provide the Ethereum
      address of the delegate.

      After delegating, you will have to confirm the transaction via MetaMask
      and monitor its status. Once completed, observe the updated delegation
      status in the Voting Wallet section. For Delegate Voting, note that your
      votes now match your COMP balance, with future insights into your
      delegate's voting activity available over time.
