      In collaboration with Compound, OpenZeppelin has developed a structured
      procedure for listing assets. This method, intended to address the
      security risks of Compound, derives from a comprehensive review of past
      asset listing proposals, community discussions, and processes adopted by
      other protocols. The resulting process includes a detailed checklist for
      security risk assessment and a sequential guide for asset listing
      proposals.


      Users looking to implement this process must initially refer to the
      Process Guide, which outlines secure asset listing management from
      beginning to end. Gauntlet offers a complimentary Market Risk Assessment
      Framework within this process. The checklist is a tool for sharing
      necessary information with the community, marking the first step in the
      Asset Listing Process. An understanding of the risks is crucial, as it
      helps to comprehend the logic behind the checklist, process, and potential
      issues in integration.


      The primary aim was to develop a preliminary procedure for the community
      to follow while securely listing assets. Feedback and improvements from
      the community are welcomed and encouraged. An initial objective was to
      list main exploration results and summarize known risks of the Compound
      protocol. A Risks document was produced, focusing on risks related to
      interaction with external assets. This document serves as a guideline for
      anyone evaluating new asset listings, detailing each risk category and
      possible mitigation through existing designs.


      Post risk analysis, it was recognized that the specific risks associated
      with an asset must be taken into account during its listing. Hence, a
      checklist of queries and information requests was created for use during
      the asset listing process. This checklist aims to address all concerns
      specific to each asset and its integration. Before proposing an asset
      listing, the proposer must review this checklist and provide the requested
      information for a community check on potential integration issues. The
      final part of this process involves reviewing the risks, completing the
      checklist, and following other intermediate steps.


      This effort intends to establish a secure and structured asset listing
      process, adaptable to community feedback and enhancements over time.
      Suggested improvements for the future include automated integrations for
      mandatory checklist completion, auto-completion of the checklist to ease
      proposal submission, modifications to the checklist based on community
      needs, improvements in tooling, formal processes for community member
      roles in checklist verification, and creation of a scoring framework.

      The Compound Asset Listing Checklist provides a thorough framework for
      anyone proposing a new asset listing. First, general information about the
      token asset, including the name, project description, potential benefits
      to the Compound community, and pertinent resources such as websites and
      social media links, must be provided. Information about the proposer,
      their relationship with the token, and any social channel metrics are also
      required.


      Next, a detailed Market Risk Assessment is necessary. This involves
      submitting the token's market cap, its historical volatility, the largest
      exchanges where it is listed, and any major smart contract balances.
      Information about the token's total supply and emission schedule is also
      needed. It's important to note that Gauntlet, a simulation platform for
      building financial models of blockchain protocols and applications, will
      pull live data for their market risk assessment after the checklist is
      submitted.


      Thirdly, the decentralization aspect of the asset needs to be considered.
      Information about the asset's distribution among token holders, privileged
      roles in the token contract, and whether the asset is pausable or has a
      blacklist or whitelist should be provided.


      The fourth section delves into smart contract risks, considering the
      asset's codebase, on-chain activity, and overall security posture. The
      proposer must provide information about audits, active bug bounty
      programs, and emergency contacts, as well as any additional security tools
      used in development.


      The fifth section explores the token's multi-chain strategy and contract
      behavior. Information about whether the token will include implementations
      on other networks, how it deviates from a standard ERC20 implementation,
      and its unique features should be provided.


      Finally, the price feed behavior, upgradability, and initial requirements
      need to be assessed. This includes the frequency of price updates, the
      entity responsible for these updates, and the threshold for price change
      that triggers an update. Additionally, information about the token's
      upgradability, who is authorized to upgrade it, and the upgradeability
      design should be presented. A few initial requirements include setting the
      collateral factor to 0 and establishing a supply cap if necessary.


      Community members should review all the information provided carefully
      before approving a new asset. Verification of the information, assessment
      of new contracts, evaluation of documentation quality, and review of the
      token test suite or integration simulations results are all vital parts of
      the community check. All proposals must be first posted in the Compound
      forum New Markets category, and each proposal should relate solely to the
      listing of one token.
