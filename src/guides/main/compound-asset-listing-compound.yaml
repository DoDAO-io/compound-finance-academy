      The Compound Asset Listing Checklist provides a thorough framework for
      anyone proposing a new asset listing. First, general information about the
      token asset, including the name, project description, potential benefits
      to the Compound community, and pertinent resources such as websites and
      social media links, must be provided. Information about the proposer,
      their relationship with the token, and any social channel metrics are also
      required.


      Next, a detailed Market Risk Assessment is necessary. This involves
      submitting the token's market cap, its historical volatility, the largest
      exchanges where it is listed, and any major smart contract balances.
      Information about the token's total supply and emission schedule is also
      needed. It's important to note that Gauntlet, a simulation platform for
      building financial models of blockchain protocols and applications, will
      pull live data for their market risk assessment after the checklist is
      submitted.


      Thirdly, the decentralization aspect of the asset needs to be considered.
      Information about the asset's distribution among token holders, privileged
      roles in the token contract, and whether the asset is pausable or has a
      blacklist or whitelist should be provided.


      The fourth section delves into smart contract risks, considering the
      asset's codebase, on-chain activity, and overall security posture. The
      proposer must provide information about audits, active bug bounty
      programs, and emergency contacts, as well as any additional security tools
      used in development.


      The fifth section explores the token's multi-chain strategy and contract
      behavior. Information about whether the token will include implementations
      on other networks, how it deviates from a standard ERC20 implementation,
      and its unique features should be provided.


      Finally, the price feed behavior, upgradability, and initial requirements
      need to be assessed. This includes the frequency of price updates, the
      entity responsible for these updates, and the threshold for price change
      that triggers an update. Additionally, information about the token's
      upgradability, who is authorized to upgrade it, and the upgradeability
      design should be presented. A few initial requirements include setting the
      collateral factor to 0 and establishing a supply cap if necessary.


      Community members should review all the information provided carefully
      before approving a new asset. Verification of the information, assessment
      of new contracts, evaluation of documentation quality, and review of the
      token test suite or integration simulations results are all vital parts of
      the community check. All proposals must be first posted in the Compound
      forum New Markets category, and each proposal should relate solely to the
      listing of one token.
