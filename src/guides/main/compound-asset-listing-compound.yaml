      In collaboration with Compound, OpenZeppelin has developed a structured
      procedure for listing assets. This method, intended to address the
      security risks of Compound, derives from a comprehensive review of past
      asset listing proposals, community discussions, and processes adopted by
      other protocols. The resulting process includes a detailed checklist for
      security risk assessment and a sequential guide for asset listing
      proposals.


      Users looking to implement this process must initially refer to the
      Process Guide, which outlines secure asset listing management from
      beginning to end. Gauntlet offers a complimentary Market Risk Assessment
      Framework within this process. The checklist is a tool for sharing
      necessary information with the community, marking the first step in the
      Asset Listing Process. An understanding of the risks is crucial, as it
      helps to comprehend the logic behind the checklist, process, and potential
      issues in integration.


      The primary aim was to develop a preliminary procedure for the community
      to follow while securely listing assets. Feedback and improvements from
      the community are welcomed and encouraged. An initial objective was to
      list main exploration results and summarize known risks of the Compound
      protocol. A Risks document was produced, focusing on risks related to
      interaction with external assets. This document serves as a guideline for
      anyone evaluating new asset listings, detailing each risk category and
      possible mitigation through existing designs.


      Post risk analysis, it was recognized that the specific risks associated
      with an asset must be taken into account during its listing. Hence, a
      checklist of queries and information requests was created for use during
      the asset listing process. This checklist aims to address all concerns
      specific to each asset and its integration. Before proposing an asset
      listing, the proposer must review this checklist and provide the requested
      information for a community check on potential integration issues. The
      final part of this process involves reviewing the risks, completing the
      checklist, and following other intermediate steps.


      This effort intends to establish a secure and structured asset listing
      process, adaptable to community feedback and enhancements over time.
      Suggested improvements for the future include automated integrations for
      mandatory checklist completion, auto-completion of the checklist to ease
      proposal submission, modifications to the checklist based on community
      needs, improvements in tooling, formal processes for community member
      roles in checklist verification, and creation of a scoring framework.

      ### Process for New Asset Listing on Compoundv3


      <div align="center">
        <img style="max-height:400px;margin-bottom:30px" src="https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/compound-eth-1/Guide/compound_asset_listing_compound/1689953114048_new_asset_listing_process.png"/>
      </div>



      The first step in the new asset listing process on Compoundv3 is the
      submission of a request for asset listing. A new market proposer must
      review the Checklist and provide as much requested information as possible
      in a forum post titled "Add market: {ASSET SYMBOL}" in the "New Markets"
      category of the Compound forum.


      Following the request, the next stage is the community analysis which
      comprises of verification, risk analysis, and tooling and simulations.
      Community member(s) oversee the review of the provided information,
      ensuring its correctness and completeness. The community also evaluates
      the market risks of the asset using available data, potentially utilizing
      a scoring system. Gauntlet supplies a market risk assessment framework for
      this stage. Finally, community member(s) execute the available test suite
      and simulations against the contracts deployed on the target network.


      The process advances to the finalization of deployment once the community
      analysis is complete. Here, the promoter is required to deploy any
      auxiliary contracts such as a price feed modifier and share the deployed
      contract addresses in the same forum post. A formal on-chain proposal is
      then drafted, including necessary parameters and explaining the reasoning
      behind each proposed parameter value.


      Optionally, the proposal undergoes an audit. This step is taken if the
      community requests a review by security auditors, which can be performed
      by OpenZeppelin or a third party hired by the proposal author.


      Following the audit, the on-chain proposal is submitted for voting. If the
      proposal fails, the forum post is updated with the results and provides a
      platform for follow-up discussions.


      The final stage of the process takes place post-launch. Parameters such as
      the collateral factor are adjusted to safe levels and the reserve factor
      is set to align with other assets. Additionally, optional borrow limits
      can be set.

      The Compound Asset Listing Checklist provides a thorough framework for
      anyone proposing a new asset listing. First, general information about the
      token asset, including the name, project description, potential benefits
      to the Compound community, and pertinent resources such as websites and
      social media links, must be provided. Information about the proposer,
      their relationship with the token, and any social channel metrics are also
      required.


      Next, a detailed Market Risk Assessment is necessary. This involves
      submitting the token's market cap, its historical volatility, the largest
      exchanges where it is listed, and any major smart contract balances.
      Information about the token's total supply and emission schedule is also
      needed. It's important to note that Gauntlet, a simulation platform for
      building financial models of blockchain protocols and applications, will
      pull live data for their market risk assessment after the checklist is
      submitted.


      Thirdly, the decentralization aspect of the asset needs to be considered.
      Information about the asset's distribution among token holders, privileged
      roles in the token contract, and whether the asset is pausable or has a
      blacklist or whitelist should be provided.


      The fourth section delves into smart contract risks, considering the
      asset's codebase, on-chain activity, and overall security posture. The
      proposer must provide information about audits, active bug bounty
      programs, and emergency contacts, as well as any additional security tools
      used in development.


      The fifth section explores the token's multi-chain strategy and contract
      behavior. Information about whether the token will include implementations
      on other networks, how it deviates from a standard ERC20 implementation,
      and its unique features should be provided.


      Finally, the price feed behavior, upgradability, and initial requirements
      need to be assessed. This includes the frequency of price updates, the
      entity responsible for these updates, and the threshold for price change
      that triggers an update. Additionally, information about the token's
      upgradability, who is authorized to upgrade it, and the upgradeability
      design should be presented. A few initial requirements include setting the
      collateral factor to 0 and establishing a supply cap if necessary.


      Community members should review all the information provided carefully
      before approving a new asset. Verification of the information, assessment
      of new contracts, evaluation of documentation quality, and review of the
      token test suite or integration simulations results are all vital parts of
      the community check. All proposals must be first posted in the Compound
      forum New Markets category, and each proposal should relate solely to the
      listing of one token.

      ## Protocol Risks

      The protocol risks in the Compound asset listing involve multiple factors
      that are explained below


      ### Codebase vulnerability

      The smart contract contains potential bugs that could be exploited. To
      address this concern, the Compound team has thoroughly tested the codebase
      and subjected it to multiple rounds of audits.


      Failures in external integrations: Compound currently relies on Chainlink
      oracles to obtain price data. Any manipulations or inaccuracies in these
      oracles could result in price manipulations, which are discussed further
      in the market risk section.


      ### Governance Risks

      Governance risks involve problems like wrong governance actions or
      governance attacks. An example of the former is the execution of a
      proposal containing harmful transactions, such as a large-scale COMP
      distribution issue. To circumvent this, OpenZeppelin's relationship with
      Compound has been established to prevent proposals that could undermine
      the protocol.


      In the case of governance attacks, there's a potential risk of large
      quantities of COMP being concentrated through loans or purchases in a few
      wallets, which could threaten the governance system. However, this is
      currently considered an unrealistic risk due to the lack of concrete
      examples.


      ### Market Risks

      The market risks, extensively analysed in Gauntlet's report, involve price
      manipulation, insolvency risk, non-incentivized liquidations, and a
      cascading effect of liquidations. If price manipulation occurs in a low
      liquidity market, it could lead to the liquidation of honest borrowers.
      Insolvency risk refers to a situation where the protocol's liabilities
      surpass its funds. A significant price crash could render liquidations
      unprofitable, leading to a dearth of incentivized liquidators. The cascade
      effect refers to a deflationary spiral caused by liquidations triggering
      more liquidations. To mitigate this, proposal #49 has been suggested.


      ### Network Risks

      With Compound smart contracts deployed on various networks, each having
      unique dynamics, security models, and asset pools, network risks become a
      consideration. By venturing into these networks, Compound assumes risks
      related to network design, evm compatibility, bridge security, and native
      vs bridged asset dynamics, among others.



      ## Asset-Specific Risks

      Asset-specific risks must be dealt with in a structured manner.
      OpenZeppelin suggests a checklist for topics to be reviewed when
      onboarding new assets. This checklist is complemented by a comprehensive
      process for listing new assets.


      ### Compatibility

      This involves checking how extra asset features could potentially
      interfere with the ERC20 functions involved in Compound integration. Also,
      the degree of deviation of an asset from the ERC20 standard could affect
      the protocol's fundamental assumptions on how ERC20 tokens behave.


      ### Compliance

      An asset's level of decentralization needs to be considered since a highly
      centralized asset could lead to unexpected minting and failed transfers
      due to blacklisting features. Additionally, like all smart contracts,
      assets may contain bugs that could be exploited, potentially causing
      issues with Compound. Therefore, identifying these bugs and studying their
      implications becomes critical.


      Lastly, it's crucial to note the specific interactions between Compound
      and external asset contracts. Various protocol contracts interact with
      ERC20 tokens, including cTokens, and relative functions interacting in
      Comet, CometRewards, BaseBulker, MainnetBulker, and GovernorBravoDelegate.


      ### External Token interactions


      Compoun interacts with external asset contracts including ERC20 tokens
      through various functions. Comet, an integral part of the system, employs
      functions like `doTransferIn` and `doTransferOut`, relying on the
      `transferFrom` and `transfer` functions of the ERC20 tokens, respectively.
      The `doTransferIn` function is used by other Comet functions like
      `supply`, `supplyTo`, `supplyFrom`, and `buyCollateral`, whereas
      `doTransferOut` is called upon by functions like `withdraw`, `withdrawTo`,
      `withdrawFrom`, `withdrawReserves`, and `buyCollateral`. Another function,
      `approveThis`, enables the governor to approve any token within the
      system. Additionally, `getPackedAssetInternal` and `getCollateralReserves`
      utilize ERC20 functions to verify asset integrity and manage reserves.
      These interactions ensure seamless transactions within the Compound
      protocol.


      Other components like `CometRewards` and `BaseBulker` also engage with
      external contracts. CometRewards uses `doTransferOut` for token transfers,
      and `setRewardConfig` to establish reward schemes. BaseBulker, on the
      other hand, employs `sweepToken` for asset removal by an admin, and
      `doTransferIn` to facilitate token transfers from a user. MainnetBulker, a
      special case that lends out ETH against different collaterals, also
      employs `doTransferIn` and `doTransferOut`, specifically for the tokens
      steth and wsteth. Lastly, the GovernorBravoDelegate manages voting using
      `castVoteInternal` and cancellation of proposals with the cancel function.
      All these interactions demonstrate a robust and flexible system
      architecture that allows for diverse asset management and protocol
      governance within Compound.
