      This comprehensive guide is designed to equip any community member with
      the necessary information and resources to independently draft a token
      report. Each report will focus on one token across multiple chains,
      detailing the specifics of its behavior, structure, and utilization on
      each chain. 


      The objective of the token report is to provide a succinct, comprehensive
      examination of the token in question, its functionality on various chains,
      and its overall implications for users. To achieve this, the report is
      divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the
      token. From an Executive Overview, providing a summarized introduction, to
      sections detailing various features like 'Upgradeable', 'Burnable', and
      'FlashMintable' - all these components of the report play a vital role in
      providing a holistic understanding of the token.


      As a report writer, you are encouraged to present information in a clear
      and concise manner, aiming to create a coherent document that effortlessly
      guides the reader through the complexities of the token analysis. Each
      section, be it the 'Summary Page', 'Details and Backup', or the
      'Disclaimer', contributes to the overall understanding of the token's
      properties and behavior. With this guide as your reference, you'll be
      equipped to explore and articulate the intricacies of token behavior on
      various chains, a fundamental aspect of understanding the dynamic world of
      digital currencies.


      The structure of the report is informed by the security recommendations
      outlined by OpenZeppelin, as detailed in this
      [guide](https://compound.education/guides/view/compound-asset-listing-compound/0)
      and further elaborated in this [GitHub
      repository](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compound-assets-listing).

      The report comprises the following sections:


      ### Executive Overview


      This section provides a brief, high-level summary of the report in no more
      than three paragraphs. It introduces the token's name, its uses, and the
      organization that originated it. Moreover, it presents a rundown of the
      token report's key highlights for each chain. This section typically has
      one paragraph dedicated to the token and another paragraph highlighting
      aspects related to each chain.


      ### Summary Page


      The Summary Page is a one-page review of every aspect examined for the
      token on a specific chain. It presents a succinct summary of all points of
      investigation, linking to the respective sections in the document for
      detailed insights. Each token/chain combination will have its distinct
      summary page.


      ### Details and Backup


      This section dives deeper into the details for each token on each chain
      included in the report. It comprises a comprehensive breakdown of the
      following elements:


      1. **Token on Chain**: This section will present a detailed view of the
      token on its respective chain, such as wBTC on Ethereum Mainnet.


      2. **Pausable**: This part covers whether the token contract can be paused
      or not, detailing who can pause it and how it works if applicable.


      3. **BlackListable**: This segment explores if there's any blacklist code
      within the token contract, outlining its functionalities and which
      features it impacts if present.


      4. **ERC-20 Standard Compliance**: Here, we'll verify if all function
      calls of the token contract adhere to the ERC-20 standard, summarizing the
      overall status.


      5. **Math Protection**: This section discusses whether the token contract
      has math protection against overflows and underflows.


      6. **Mintable**: This area explores if the token's contract allows the
      owner to mint new tokens and provides a detailed description if
      applicable.


      7. **Burnable**: This section investigates if the token contract permits
      the owner to burn tokens, offering a comprehensive explanation if
      relevant.


      8. **Rebasing**: This portion deals with whether the token code allows for
      rebasing of the total number of tokens issued, providing a detailed
      explanation and code snippets if necessary.


      9. **Fees on transfer**: This segment covers if any fees are levied on the
      token transfer and details the logic behind such fees if they exist.


      10. **DelegateCalls**: This part focuses on the presence of DelegateCall
      functions in the token code that can potentially add significant risks to
      the DeFi protocol.


      11. **Flashloanable**: This area investigates whether the token can be
      used in a flash loan, providing a detailed analysis if the answer is
      affirmative.


      12. **FlashMintable**: This section checks if the token allows flash mints
      and explains the potential impacts on price and total supply if flash
      mints can occur.

      Here is the sample of Executive Overview and Summary of USDC on Ethereum



      ## Executive Overview

      USDC is a centralized stable coin run by Circle Corporation.  It is highly
      permissioned. The token can be upgraded, paused and has blacklists.  This
      report covers USDC on Ethereum mainnet and Optimism.  We can add other
      chains upon request.

      USDC on mainnet’s code is more complex than the ERC20 standard.  The code
      is upgradable it has changed 3 times, the latest on Aug 2020.  There is no
      timelock on upgrades, they are instantaneous.  Circle controls an active
      blacklist and can pause trading in USDC at any time.  The token can be
      used in flashloans.



      **Disclaimer**

      The purpose of these reports is a succinct technical summary for devs and
      auditors when considering using a token on a chain.  It is designed to use
      their time more efficiently.  DeFiSafety’s team are analysts, not devs or
      auditors.
