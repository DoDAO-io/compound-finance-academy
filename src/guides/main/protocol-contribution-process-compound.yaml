      ### About this Guide

      This guide elucidates a systematic methodology for streamlining the
      development and appraisal of protocol contributions with a specific focus
      on community engagement and quality assurance of the protocol prior to
      adoption. The guide delineates a structured series of steps, each designed
      to progressively validate and improve each contribution. These steps are
      organized into five primary stages, reflecting the journey of a
      contribution from the initial concept stage through to the conclusive
      review, before it is finally advanced to be a proposition for on-chain
      governance.


      ### Motivation

      The objective behind this guide is to introduce a higher degree of
      transparency and understanding to the process of making contributions to
      the Compound protocol. The details included in the guide illustrate a
      universal approach that is capable of being applied across a wide spectrum
      of contributions, thereby making the process more inclusive and efficient.
      This methodological guide is particularly designed to facilitate and
      encourage submissions from new contributors, whilst maintaining a minimal
      burden on those who are continuing to contribute.


      The suggested structure not only accommodates input from a diverse range
      of contributors but also sets the stage for constant improvement and
      iterative refinement of ideas. By offering a clear roadmap of the
      contribution lifecycle, from ideation through final review, this guide
      seeks to strengthen the community's engagement and involvement in protocol
      development, while at the same time ensuring the high quality of the
      contributions.

      ### 5-Stage Process from Conception to Adoption for Refining Proposals


      This process includes stages for multiple refinements and feedback
      integration. The stages help to prepare proposals for varying audience
      review, and communication is advised throughout.

      </div>



      ### 1. Idea Review

      This initial stage is for idea sharing and community feedback integration.
      For grant applications, a refined idea should be ready for submission by
      stage end.


      1. Start a discussion post in the Compound Forum with sufficient detail.

      2. Gauge community interest before dedicating effort to a contribution.

      3. Refine the idea using community feedback.

      4. Outline the scope and broad technical details of the solution.

      5. Optional: For additional feedback from CIP Editors, draft a CIP-style
      proposal, especially for complex design decisions.


      ### 2. Development Review

      The aim here is to provide feature-complete code with developer feedback
      from the community. This stage suits contributions requiring new contracts
      or existing contract updates.


      1. Develop a draft contribution, including tests, for community developers
      to review.

      2. Announce the proposal in the Compound Forum and optionally in the
      #development Discord channel. Detail the contribution, its expected
      behavior, and repository location to invite feedback. Use "CIP-X:
      Development Review" as your forum post status.

      3. Request an external audit if contract code is involved.



      ### 3. Community Review

      This stage finalizes configuration and parameter values with community
      feedback.


      1. Submit a pull request and make additional commits as necessary.

      2. Post revised contribution details with test and simulation results to
      the Compound Forum for review. Use “CIP-X: Community Review” to indicate
      your contribution status.

      3. Provide a repository location and expected code freeze date to request
      a final external audit estimate, if contract code is involved.

      4. Create reports of test and simulation results.


      ### 4. External Review

      This stage rectifies any audit issues. The audited contract version should
      be the final deployed version. Only changes to code in this stage should
      be audit issue remedies, and any remediation should undergo auditor
      review.


      1. Submit the pull request and latest contract version's source control
      commit ID URL to the auditor.

      2. Update the community on the latest testing and simulation results along
      with the audit status. Use "CIP-X: External Review" as your forum post
      status.

      3. Share audit results and any other security recommendations with the
      community.



      ### 5. Final Review

      This concluding stage proposes the changes on-chain.


      1. Post audit, generate test and simulation result reports based on the
      final code commit. Use “CIP-X: Final Review” as your forum post status.

      2. Generate migration and proposal simulation results.

      3. Submit a pull request against the official protocol repository to
      include changes.

      4. Sign and execute the migration to submit the on-chain proposal.

      5. Announce the pull request with commit ID details and test and
      simulation results to the community, indicating a pending proposal vote.

      6. After a successful vote and proposal execution, test the upgrade's
      effectiveness and merge the pull request.

      This guide seeks to unify the process of contributing to the protocol,
      reflecting established best practices but broadened to be applicable in a
      wide range of situations. The call for a transparent, defined contribution
      procedure stems from historical instances of protocol updates that led to
      security vulnerabilities. Despite rigorous bug testing and proactive
      community outreach for feedback, these security issues were not detected
      until they became critical. Introducing a five-step contribution procedure
      paves the way for multiple quality control checkpoints and the early
      identification of potential security risks.


      Additionally, this structure gives contributors a clear pathway to their
      end goal, eliminating the ambiguity of deciding when and how to report
      their development progress and quality control efforts to the community.
      In the decentralized world of Compound development and governance, it's
      even more crucial that we clearly communicate the expectations for
      contributions to both contributors and DAO voters.


      ### Expected Impact

      Implementation of this process is anticipated to have several positive
      impacts. For starters, it's expected to streamline the contribution
      process for newcomers, while concurrently minimizing the burden on
      existing contributors. It's also likely to accelerate the evaluation of
      Compound Governor proposals by establishing regular, timely communication
      of evaluation criteria.


      Further, the contribution process aims to stimulate more active
      participation in both contributions and evaluation processes.
      Predictability of the process duration, a feature particularly relevant
      for grant proposals, is also set to improve. This, in turn, will foster
      confidence in protocol changes by enhancing transparency and
      accessibility.


      Additionally, this process will provide enhanced direction for grant
      recipients, making it easier for them to achieve necessary milestones
      within the Compound grants program, thereby facilitating payment
      disbursement.

      The formalization of contribution guidelines for on-chain upgrades and
      deployments aims to significantly elevate the quality assurance standard
      for each contribution, thereby reinforcing the overall protocol's
      security. This process of creating a structured framework for
      contributions doesn't prescribe the usage of specific tools for achieving
      each requirement, but it is anticipated that much of the existing
      infrastructure in the Compound repositories, particularly the testing and
      security tools, will be employed.


      This structured contribution process is expected to act as a catalyst for
      the development of additional testing and security tools for the Compound
      repositories. These tools would be designed to better streamline the
      contribution process, possibly by adding levels of automation. The goal is
      to increase efficiency, minimize potential human-induced errors, and
      reduce the turnaround time for protocol enhancements.


      The development and integration of new tools would also likely trigger a
      learning curve among contributors, thereby raising the overall skill level
      and knowledge base within the Compound ecosystem. This skills enhancement,
      along with the more robust toolset, can further drive the quality of
      contributions, making the protocol even more secure and resilient.


      In the long run, these reinforced security considerations are not only
      expected to bolster the protocol's integrity but also to fortify trust
      among users and stakeholders. After all, a more secure protocol translates
      to increased user confidence, ultimately resulting in a healthier, more
      vibrant ecosystem. So, by combining the formalization of contribution
      guidelines with the continued usage and enhancement of testing and
      security tools, we are setting the stage for a much more secure,
      efficient, and resilient protocol development process.
