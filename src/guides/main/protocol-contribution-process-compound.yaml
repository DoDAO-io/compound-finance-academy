      ### About this Guide

      This guide elucidates a systematic methodology for streamlining the
      development and appraisal of protocol contributions with a specific focus
      on community engagement and quality assurance of the protocol prior to
      adoption. The guide delineates a structured series of steps, each designed
      to progressively validate and improve each contribution. These steps are
      organized into five primary stages, reflecting the journey of a
      contribution from the initial concept stage through to the conclusive
      review, before it is finally advanced to be a proposition for on-chain
      governance.


      ### Motivation

      The objective behind this guide is to introduce a higher degree of
      transparency and understanding to the process of making contributions to
      the Compound protocol. The details included in the guide illustrate a
      universal approach that is capable of being applied across a wide spectrum
      of contributions, thereby making the process more inclusive and efficient.
      This methodological guide is particularly designed to facilitate and
      encourage submissions from new contributors, whilst maintaining a minimal
      burden on those who are continuing to contribute.


      The suggested structure not only accommodates input from a diverse range
      of contributors but also sets the stage for constant improvement and
      iterative refinement of ideas. By offering a clear roadmap of the
      contribution lifecycle, from ideation through final review, this guide
      seeks to strengthen the community's engagement and involvement in protocol
      development, while at the same time ensuring the high quality of the
      contributions.

      5-Stage Process from Conception to Adoption for Refining Proposals


      This process includes stages for multiple refinements and feedback
      integration. The stages help to prepare proposals for varying audience
      review, and communication is advised throughout.


      ### 1. Idea Review

      This initial stage is for idea sharing and community feedback integration.
      For grant applications, a refined idea should be ready for submission by
      stage end.


      1. Start a discussion post in the Compound Forum with sufficient detail.

      2. Gauge community interest before dedicating effort to a contribution.

      3. Refine the idea using community feedback.

      4. Outline the scope and broad technical details of the solution.

      5. Optional: For additional feedback from CIP Editors, draft a CIP-style
      proposal, especially for complex design decisions.


      ### 2. Development Review

      The aim here is to provide feature-complete code with developer feedback
      from the community. This stage suits contributions requiring new contracts
      or existing contract updates.


      1. Develop a draft contribution, including tests, for community developers
      to review.

      2. Announce the proposal in the Compound Forum and optionally in the
      #development Discord channel. Detail the contribution, its expected
      behavior, and repository location to invite feedback. Use "CIP-X:
      Development Review" as your forum post status.

      3. Request an external audit if contract code is involved.



      ### Community Review

      This stage finalizes configuration and parameter values with community
      feedback.


      1. Submit a pull request and make additional commits as necessary.

      2. Post revised contribution details with test and simulation results to
      the Compound Forum for review. Use “CIP-X: Community Review” to indicate
      your contribution status.

      3. Provide a repository location and expected code freeze date to request
      a final external audit estimate, if contract code is involved.

      4. Create reports of test and simulation results.


      ### External Review

      This stage rectifies any audit issues. The audited contract version should
      be the final deployed version. Only changes to code in this stage should
      be audit issue remedies, and any remediation should undergo auditor
      review.


      1. Submit the pull request and latest contract version's source control
      commit ID URL to the auditor.

      2. Update the community on the latest testing and simulation results along
      with the audit status. Use "CIP-X: External Review" as your forum post
      status.

      3. Share audit results and any other security recommendations with the
      community.



      ### Final Review

      This concluding stage proposes the changes on-chain.


      1. Post audit, generate test and simulation result reports based on the
      final code commit. Use “CIP-X: Final Review” as your forum post status.

      2. Generate migration and proposal simulation results.

      3. Submit a pull request against the official protocol repository to
      include changes.

      4. Sign and execute the migration to submit the on-chain proposal.

      5. Announce the pull request with commit ID details and test and
      simulation results to the community, indicating a pending proposal vote.

      6. After a successful vote and proposal execution, test the upgrade's
      effectiveness and merge the pull request.
