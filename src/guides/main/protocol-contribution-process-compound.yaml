      ### About this Guide

      This guide elucidates a systematic methodology for streamlining the
      development and appraisal of protocol contributions with a specific focus
      on community engagement and quality assurance protocols prior to adoption.
      The guide delineates a structured series of steps, each designed to
      progressively validate and improve each contribution. These steps are
      organized into five primary stages, reflecting the journey of a
      contribution from the initial concept stage through to the conclusive
      review, before it is finally advanced to be a proposition for on-chain
      governance.


      ### Motivation

      The objective behind this guide is to introduce a higher degree of
      transparency and understanding to the process of making contributions to
      the Compound protocol. The details included in the guide illustrate a
      universal approach that is capable of being applied across a wide spectrum
      of contributions, thereby making the process more inclusive and efficient.
      This methodological guide is particularly designed to facilitate and
      encourage submissions from new contributors, whilst maintaining a minimal
      burden on those who are continuing to contribute.


      The guide, in its essence, aims to minimize the mandate of employing
      specific tools in the contribution process. Instead, it emphasizes the
      importance of traceability, transparency, and accessibility of the
      evaluation criteria for the entire Compound community. The strategy here
      is to provide multiple junctures at which feedback can be gathered at
      early stages of the contribution process, ensuring that quality assurance
      measures are well-served.


      The suggested structure not only accommodates input from a diverse range
      of contributors but also sets the stage for constant improvement and
      iterative refinement of ideas. By offering a clear roadmap of the
      contribution lifecycle, from ideation through final review, this guide
      seeks to strengthen the community's engagement and involvement in protocol
      development, while at the same time ensuring the high quality of the
      contributions.
