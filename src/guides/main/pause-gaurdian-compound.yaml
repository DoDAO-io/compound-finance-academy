      Pause Guardian

      The Comptroller contract designates a Pause Guardian address capable of
      disabling protocol functionality. Used only in the event of an unforeseen
      vulnerability, the Pause Guardian has one and only one ability: to disable
      a select set of functions: Mint, Borrow, Transfer, and Liquidate. The
      Pause Guardian cannot unpause an action, nor can it ever prevent users
      from calling Redeem, or Repay Borrow to close positions and exit the
      protocol. COMP token-holders designate the Pause Guardian address, which
      is held by the Community Multi-Sig.

      ## Use Cases for Pause Guardian


      ### Depegging of Stablecoin


      In the event where a stablecoin depegs, falling below 90% of its target
      value, and the asset price is hardcoded, certain measures are put in
      place. The first action that should be taken is the suspension of
      borrowing. A pause can be applied by altering the borrow caps instead of
      directly putting a halt to borrowing, if that is the more preferred
      method.


      ### Inaccurate or Unavailable Price Feed


      Should a price feed become either incorrect or inaccessible, immediate
      actions are required. The primary action in such circumstances would be
      the suspension of liquidations, assuming that is necessary under the
      specific conditions.


      ### Contract Bug of Indeterminate Nature


      Given the broad range of potential contract bugs and their varying impacts
      on different parts of the protocol, diverse actions are needed. Initially,
      a pause on the affected functionality should be executed. Then, a fixed
      contract version should be developed and audited. A proposal for the
      upgraded contract should be submitted, incorporating an unpause in the
      proposal. Any pending non-critical proposals should be canceled. However,
      if the bug arose due to a recent upgrade, the affected functionality
      should be paused and a proposal to reverse the upgrade causing the bug
      should be submitted, also including an unpause in the proposal.


      ### Problematic Upgrade of an Underlying Asset


      If the implementation of an underlying asset within Compound has a
      security issue, appropriate steps should be taken. The first action is to
      pause the market for the problematic underlying asset. A proposal for a
      contract upgrade to address the vulnerability should then be submitted.
      Alternatively, cooperation with the team of the underlying asset may be
      sought to rectify the issue together.


      ### Passed Malicious Governance Proposal


      In scenarios where a malicious governance proposal passes, causing a range
      of potential contract bugs and affecting various parts of the protocol,
      certain actions are needed. If the proposal poses an immediate security
      threat to the protocol, all the affected functionalities within the
      protocol should be paused. Subsequently, a proposal to roll back the
      previous malicious proposal should be submitted.
