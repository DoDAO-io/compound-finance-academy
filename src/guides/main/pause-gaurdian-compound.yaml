      What is Pause Guardian?

      Pause Guardian is a safeguard mechanism within the Comptroller contract in
      many DeFi protocols. It's an address empowered to disable selected
      protocol functions such as Mint, Borrow, Transfer, and Liquidate,
      particularly in response to an unforeseen vulnerability or crisis
      situation. 


      Pause Gaurdian serves as an important risk management tool designed to
      preserve the integrity of the ecosystem during critical situations. This
      layer of protection ensures the system's stability and reduces the
      potential for loss during sudden market volatility or when the system
      faces unanticipated bugs or exploits.


      The role of the Pause Guardian is to pause certain functionalities within
      the protocol when triggered by certain predefined conditions. This
      includes situations like when a stablecoin depegs significantly, an
      invalid price feed is received, or when a potential contract bug is
      detected. The purpose of this temporary pause is to prevent further
      detrimental actions until the situation can be fully assessed and
      remediated. It's a safety mechanism that bolsters the resilience of the
      protocol, safeguarding the investments of users within the ecosystem.


      This critical role of the Pause Guardian is assigned by the COMP
      token-holders and is managed by the Community Multi-Sig, ensuring an
      additional layer of security for the ecosystem

      ## Use Cases for Pause Guardian


      ### Depegging of Stablecoin


      In the event where a stablecoin depegs, falling below 90% of its target
      value, and the asset price is hardcoded, certain measures are put in
      place. The first action that should be taken is the suspension of
      borrowing. A pause can be applied by altering the borrow caps instead of
      directly putting a halt to borrowing, if that is the more preferred
      method.


      ### Inaccurate or Unavailable Price Feed


      Should a price feed become either incorrect or inaccessible, immediate
      actions are required. The primary action in such circumstances would be
      the suspension of liquidations, assuming that is necessary under the
      specific conditions.


      ### Contract Bug of Indeterminate Nature


      Given the broad range of potential contract bugs and their varying impacts
      on different parts of the protocol, diverse actions are needed. Initially,
      a pause on the affected functionality should be executed. Then, a fixed
      contract version should be developed and audited. A proposal for the
      upgraded contract should be submitted, incorporating an unpause in the
      proposal. Any pending non-critical proposals should be canceled. However,
      if the bug arose due to a recent upgrade, the affected functionality
      should be paused and a proposal to reverse the upgrade causing the bug
      should be submitted, also including an unpause in the proposal.


      ### Problematic Upgrade of an Underlying Asset


      If the implementation of an underlying asset within Compound has a
      security issue, appropriate steps should be taken. The first action is to
      pause the market for the problematic underlying asset. A proposal for a
      contract upgrade to address the vulnerability should then be submitted.
      Alternatively, cooperation with the team of the underlying asset may be
      sought to rectify the issue together.


      ### Passed Malicious Governance Proposal


      In scenarios where a malicious governance proposal passes, causing a range
      of potential contract bugs and affecting various parts of the protocol,
      certain actions are needed. If the proposal poses an immediate security
      threat to the protocol, all the affected functionalities within the
      protocol should be paused. Subsequently, a proposal to roll back the
      previous malicious proposal should be submitted.

      # Pause Guardian Responsibilities


      ## 1. Guiding Risk Management

      Under the domain of **Risk Management Guidance**, Gauntlet, as the
      assigned owner, provides guidance to Multisig Members to effectively
      manage risks during a security incident. This ranges from identifying
      market conditions posing a risk to Compound, such as asset price levels,
      COMP distribution, and liquidity levels in borrowing and lending pools, to
      advising on interest rates and borrow/supply limits. Gauntlet also
      recommends risk mitigation strategies, especially concerning the
      implementation of pauses during risky situations.


      ## 2. Ensuring Security Best Practices and Alerting

      **Security Best Practices and Alerting**, owned by OpenZeppelin, is
      focused on enhancing the security of the protocol. It involves developing,
      monitoring, and reviewing security alerts and conducting further
      investigations to determine if these alerts pose any threat to the
      protocol. OpenZeppelin also provides guidance on implementing best
      practices for the Pause Guardian's functionality.


      ## 3. Auditing for Secure Operations

      **Audits** are an integral part of maintaining the protocol's integrity.
      The Community, Protocol Contributors, and OpenZeppelin, who share the
      responsibility, ensure that all contracts are audited before deployment.
      Although OpenZeppelin typically spearheads the audits, the community is
      encouraged to seek additional independent audits.


      ## 4. Enforcing Pause in Case of Security Incidents

      The **Pause** responsibility rests with the Multisig Members and
      OpenZeppelin. They bear the responsibility of initiating pauses on
      specific functionalities in the event of a security incident.


      ## 5. Managing Unpause Process

      The **Unpause** functionality, owned by the Community, plays a crucial
      role in resuming operations after a pause. In v2, the unpausing can only
      be accomplished by a community governance proposal and is subject to a
      7-day governance process. However, in v3, the Pause Guardian Multisig can
      directly unpause without necessitating a governance proposal.


      ## 6. Overseeing Contract Upgrades

      Lastly, **Contract Upgrades** are vital for enhancing the protocol's
      security and functionality. Protocol Contributors are responsible for
      developing and testing contract upgrades, while OpenZeppelin provides
      guidance on mitigating security issues and performs audits on these
      upgrades, ensuring they meet security standards and resolve any potential
      concerns.
