name: OZ Contracts - Audit Report
excerpt: >-
  Captures a comprehensive record of the security audits conducted on the
  OpenZeppelin Contracts
content: >-
  Since Solidity's inception in 2016, OpenZeppelin Contracts has remained the
  preferred library for smart contract 

  development. Its widespread adoption spans from major projects handling
  billions of dollars daily to individual 

  blockchain application creators.

  <br/>



  The importance of auditing cannot be overstated. By subjecting OpenZeppelin
  Contracts to rigorous security 

  practices, the safety and reliability of these smart contracts are ensured.
  The thorough security process 

  not only safeguards the contracts themselves but also serves as a model for
  other crypto companies seeking to 

  establish their security measures. Through testing and showcasing internal
  audit practices, a valuable reference 

  example is offered to the broader security-conscious community in the crypto
  space.

      Initiative Overview

      OpenZeppelin has been selected to provide Compound DAO security services,
      including continuous audit, security advisory, and monitoring. Michael
      Lewellen is acting as OpenZeppelinâ€™s Protocol Security Advisor (PSA) for
      the Compound community. The primary objectives are to audit existing
      contracts, establish security processes, and develop an open monitoring
      system.
