excerpt: >-
  Captures a comprehensive record of the security audits conducted on the
  OpenZeppelin Contracts
content: >-
  Since Solidity's inception in 2016, OpenZeppelin Contracts has remained the
  preferred library for smart contract 

  development. Its widespread adoption spans from major projects handling
  billions of dollars daily to individual 

  blockchain application creators.

  <br/>



  The importance of auditing cannot be overstated. By subjecting OpenZeppelin
  Contracts to rigorous security 

  practices, the safety and reliability of these smart contracts are ensured.
  The thorough security process 

  not only safeguards the contracts themselves but also serves as a model for
  other crypto companies seeking to 

  establish their security measures. Through testing and showcasing internal
  audit practices, a valuable reference 

  example is offered to the broader security-conscious community in the crypto
  space.

      Initiative Overview

      OpenZeppelin has been selected to provide Compound DAO security services,
      including continuous audit, security advisory, and monitoring. Michael
      Lewellen is acting as OpenZeppelin’s Protocol Security Advisor (PSA) for
      the Compound community. The primary objectives are to audit existing
      contracts, establish security processes, and develop an open monitoring
      system.

      Over April, OpenZeppelin concluded an audit of the new Open Oracle
      upgrade. Upcoming audits include small PRs and a longer audit of
      Compound's new protocol version, "Comet." We introduced a secure asset
      listing process, reviewed security, and added security monitoring bots to
      Discord.

      Compound Governor contract on Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon Network.</p>

      <p>Security Considerations & Trust Assumptions: Interlinked contracts,
      reliance on Polygon bridge security, trust in validators, potential delay
      issues.</p>


      <h2>Medium Severity Findings</h2>

      <p>1. BaseBridgeReceiver localTimelock issue.</p>

      <p>2. Proposal cancellation limitation.</p>


      <h2>Low Severity Findings</h2>

      <p>1. Reverted proposals not seen in Ethereum.</p>

      <p>2. Inconsistent transaction expiry.</p>

      <p>3. Inconsistent usage of uint across loops.</p>

      <p>4. Missing indexed parameter in an event.</p>

      <p>5. Lack of distinction between queued and ready-to-execute state.</p>

      <p>6. Identical transactions executed inside the same proposal.</p>

      Compoundv3, referred to hereafter as Comet, uses Chainlink as its source
      of asset prices. Currently, it prices WBTC using Chainlink's BTC price
      feed. The idea being that the price of BTC should be close to the price of
      WBTC and generally that is true. But in the case of market panic or
      catastrophe, there is a chance that the price of WBTC could be drastically
      different, creating issues or distortions in the protocol that could risk
      user funds. The newly proposed price feed involves pricing WBTC more
      accurately in those cases, using Chainlink's WBTC/BTC price feed in
      conjunction with the BTC/USD price feed to create a WBTC/USD pricing
      function.


      Of course, the purported gains in accuracy of the pricing function depend
      on the resilience of the Chainlink network of aggregators and operators to
      provide accurate data. Both of the price feeds to be integrated are
      described by Chainlink as "Verified Feeds", the highest grade of quality
      that they assign. However, we recommend independently monitoring the
      health of these feeds to ensure they meet the standards set forth by the
      Compound community.


      Consider monitoring the number of aggregators and node operators that are
      healthy and participating in these price feeds.
